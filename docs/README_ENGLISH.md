Introduction :

This project has been realized to pass Computer Graphics subject on Politechnika Rzeszowska.
The first goal was to make 3d model of tank: Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger (P) (one of most popular germans tanks from II World War)
Beside tank I have used some free 3d samples that including: trees, grass and free textures for that models.
Project has been made using pure C++, OpenGL and few other libs.

Manual:

Libs used:

** OpenGL ** ** SOIL ** ** GLEW ** ** GLM ** ** FREEGLUT **
